# Runner game

It's a clone from dinosaur runner on Google Chrome which appears when you lose internet connection. The game is written in Python with Pygame, it's the first game project I have ever done.

## Features

For now, the main character is only capable of dodging the snails, I will update the dodging flies soon.

## Upcoming features

Resize full-screen, dodging flies and may be more music.

## Reference

Thanks *Clear Code* for making a tutorial video about this game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk
I learn basic from this video, then I will develop some new features.
